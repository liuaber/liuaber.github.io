Abstract:


Modeling excess remains to be an important topic in insurance data modeling. Among the alternatives of
modeling excess, the Peaks Over Threshold (POT) framework with Generalized Pareto distribution (GPD)
is regarded as an efficient approach due to its flexibility. However, the selection of an appropriate threshold
for such framework is a major difficulty. To address such difficulty, we applied several accumulation tests
along with Anderson-Darling test to determine an optimal threshold. Based on the selected thresholds,
the fitted GPD with the estimated quantiles can be found. We applied the procedure to the well-known
Norwegian Fire Insurance data and constructed the confidence intervals for the Value-at-Risks (VaR). The
accumulation test approach provides satisfactory performance in modeling the high quantiles of Norwegian
Fire Insurance data compared to the previous graphical methods.
