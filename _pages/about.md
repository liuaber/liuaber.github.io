Extreme Data Modeling
======

As a PhD candidate, my major focus is modeling extreme data with parametric models. Along with my advisor, [Dr Malwane M.A. Ananda](https://www.unlv.edu/people/malwane-ananda), I published two papers about a new family of parametric models for extreme data modeling. The models demonstrated great performances in modeling several actuarial and insurance claim size data sets. Currently, we are exploring more theoretical properties of these models. In addition, we are applying these models with the reliability data sets. 

Classical and Bayesian Meta-analysis 
======

As a previous research assistant in Nevada Institute of Personalized Medicine ([NIPM](https://www.unlv.edu/nipm)), I cooperated with Professor Qing Wu ([Currenlty Professor at the Ohio State University](https://cancer.osu.edu/for-cancer-researchers/resources-for-cancer-researchers/shared-resources/biostatistics/expertise)) since year 2018. We published several papers together including three papers in classical and Bayesian meta-analysis. Most importantly, we focused on the possible factors that associates with osteporotic fractures, which is known as a major global public health concern. We're currently working on a review paper to sumamrize the statistical methodologies used in classical and meta-analysis.
