title: "C-reactive protein and fracture risk: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies through the use of both frequentist and Bayesian approaches"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021_paper2
excerpt: 'This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on all eligible cohort studies to evaluate the association between high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and osteoporotic fracture risk. Both frequentist and Bayesian approaches were employed for the meta-analysis. We found that high tertiles of hs-CRP were significantly associated with increased fracture risk.'
