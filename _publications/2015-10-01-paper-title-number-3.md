permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose a new family of distributions, by exponentiating the random variables associated with the probability density functions of composite distributions. We also derive some mathematical properties of this new family of distributions, including the moments and the limited moments. Specifically, two special models in this family are discussed. Three real datasets were chosen, to assess the performance of these two special exponentiated-composite models. When fitting to these three datasets, these three special exponentiated-composite distributions demonstrate significantly better performance, compared to the original composite distributions.'

In this paper, we propose a new family of distributions, by exponentiating the random variables associated with the probability density functions of composite distributions. We also derive some mathematical properties of this new family of distributions, including the moments and the limited moments. Specifically, two special models in this family are discussed. Three real datasets were chosen, to assess the performance of these two special exponentiated-composite models. When fitting to these three datasets, these three special exponentiated-composite distributions demonstrate significantly better performance, compared to the original composite distributions.
