This meta-analysis examined studies on the relationship between teachers’ self-efficacy and technology integration in K-12 education. A total of 14 studies in this meta-analysis with 3272 participants including 532 pre-service teachers and 2740 inservice teachers from Finland, Taiwan, US, Turkey, and Korea. Findings indicated that teachers’ self-efficacy had a positive relationship with their technology integration in K-12 education (r=. 32); however, the relationship between teachers’ self-efficacy and their technology integration did not differ significantly in terms of population (ie, pre-service teachers vs. in-service teachers), region (ie, US versus Finland, Taiwan, Turkey, and Korea), and sample size (n= 300). Implications for both pre-service and in-service teachers’ professional development with selfefficacy and technology integration were provided.
